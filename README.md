# Graph Stochastic Wilson-Cowan Model

Main results are semi-analytic stability conditions and harmonic spectra calculations for noise-induced fluctuations about the steady state in the linearised model. Code for numerical simulations of the fully nonlinear system is also present, but noted that it is computationally very intensive.
