# Graph-Neural-FIeld-Models

Code for Wilson-Cowan-like neural field models on the connectome graph. Main results are semi-analytic steady state stability analysis and harmonic spectrum calculations for the linearised case. Code for numerical simulations of the full system is also present, but mostly nonoptimized and computationally intensive.
