# Graph-Neural-FIeld-Models

Code for Wilson-Cowan-like stochastic neural field models on the connectome graph. Main results are semi-analytic stability conditions and harmonic spectra calculations for noise-induced fluctuations about the steady state in the linearised model. Code for numerical simulations of the fully nonlinear system is also present, but noted that it is computationally very intensive.
